This is the repo for Mine Sweep Battle (MSB), a game project created for University of Tartu course Computer Game Development and Design (MTAT.03.263) during fall semester 22/23.

## Our Vision

With MSB our aim was to create an experience simple in nature that could be expanded upon, in order to create space for emergent gameplay and to make the game as accessible as possible to a wide range of players. We focused on refining the basic gameplay loop, getting the core action to feel good.

## Why it's not Just Minesweeper

Differences from regular minesweeper include being able to move in the mine field as a character, being able to shoot cells with beams, a lobby system for competing online against other players during rounds of play that are limited by time (and will also end when no cells are left), a custom scoring system refined specifically for this game that makes different strategies viable, using powerups â€” a speed powerup that stacks up to 4x making for funny zooming and a bomb powerup that can be used to either blow up cells or to stun other players. Stunning players gives a ton of points and so is the most prominent feature showcasing direct confrontation in the game, as it helps one player's progress while hindering another's. Also, the better a player is doing in the game, the more points are awarded to anyone able to stun them, which eliminates the tactic of everyone attacking the weakest player for easy profit.

## Technologies Used

All assets except the font (which is in the public domain) were made by us from scratch. The music and SFX were made by Mihkel Roomet using [Beepbox](https://www.beepbox.co/). Graphical assets were made by Mihkel Roomet and Kaarel Koido using [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html). The game engine we used was [Unity 2021.3.11f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.11). For online multiplayer we used [Photon](https://www.photonengine.com/).

## Our Team

The team working on MSB included Mihkel Roomet, Kaarel Koido and Muruganantham Jaisankar. None of us had any prior experience with game projects.
